RUNNING THE pda SIMULATOR
-------------------------

To run the pda simulator, enter


p quintuplefilename_less-extension


The extension ".p" is assumed for the quintuple file name.  The 
tape file name is assumed to be the same as the quintuple file 
name but with the extension is ".pp". 


Name file p.ppp
---------------

When the simulator is run for the first time, it prompts for the 
user's name:

Enter familyname firstname middleinitial (if any)  

After the user enters this information, the simulator saves it in 
a file named p.ppp.  It then inserts this name information in all 
the trace files it subsequently creates. If the name entered is 
not correct, the p.ppp file can be directly edited with any text 
editor.  Alternatively, the p.ppp file can be deleted.  Then 
when the simulator is run again, it will prompt for and read in 
new name information.  


QUINTUPLE FILE
--------------

The first line of the quintuple file should contain the start 
state of the pda.  The start state can be any integer. A comment 
can appear on the same line as the start state, following the 
start state.    

The final states (i.e., accept states) are listed on the second 
line of the quintuple file.  A final state can be any integer.  
Succesive final states should be separated by at least one blank.  
A comment that does not start with an integer can appear to the 
right of the list of final states. 
  
If no final states are given, the second line should be 
completely blank or contain a comment that does not start with an 
integer.  If no final states are given, the simulator will accept 
by the empty stack criterion.  

If the character & appears on the second line, the simulator will 
accept by final state and empty stack.  If final states are 
specifed but & does not appear, the simulator will accept by 
final state.   

Examples: 

If second line is 

0 1 2 3 

acceptance is by final state.  

If the second line is

0 1 2 3  &

acceptance is by final state and empty stack.  

If the second line is completely blank or contains just a comment 
that does not start with an integer, acceptance is by empty 
stack. 


The quintuples for the pda should start on the third line.  One 
quintuple should be specified per line.  Blank lines can appear 
before and/or after any quintuple line.  The components of a 
quintuple should be specified in the following order: 


CURRENTSTATE CURRENTINPUT TOPOFSTACK NEWSTATE PUSHSTRING


One or more spaces should separate each component of a quintuple. 
CURRENTSTATE and NEWSTATE can be any integer. 

CURRENTINPUT and TOPOFSTACK can be any non-blank character.  
Use ? to represent a blank.  CURRENTINPUT, TOPOFSTACK, and/or 
PUSHSTRING can be ^, where ^ designates the null string.  

PUSHSTRING can be any string.  Use ^ to represent the null 
string.

Comments can appear to the right of each quintuple.

Sample quintuple file:

0                Start state
0 4              Final states
0 ^ ^ 1 $        This pda accepts {a^nb^n | n >= 0}
1 a $ 2 a$   
2 a a 2 aa
2 b a 3 ^        ^ represents null string
3 b a 3 ^
3 ^ $ 4 ^    


INPUT TAPE FILE
---------------

The input tape file should consist of one or more lines.  Each 
line represents one input tape.  An input tape can consist of any 
sequence of characters.  Blanks embedded within an input tape 
should be represented by ? (one ? for each blank).  A completely 
blank input tape is represented by a single ?. 

The pda simulator treats each line in the tape file as a separate 
input tape and makes one run for each line. If one or more final 
states are specified and either the letter a or the letter r 
preceded by at least one blank appears on the right of a tape, 
the result of the run--ACCEPT or REJECT--is checked.  If the 
letter a is specified, the result should be ACCEPT; if the letter 
r is specified, the result should be REJECT.  If the result 
differs from that specified on the tape, the error message 
"Wrong" appears at the end of the trace for that tape, and the 
error message "Errors detected" appears at the bottom of the 
trace for the entire run.  If no errors are detected during an 
entire run, the message "No errors detected" appears at the 
bottom of the trace for the entire run.  


Sample input tape file: 

?                                                            a
ab                                                           a
aabb                                                         a
abab                                                         r
abb                                                          r
aab                                                          r
a                                                            r
b                                                            r



TRACE
-----

The trace generated by the simulator is written to BOTH the 
display screen and a file with the same name as the quintuple 
file but with the extension ".<familyname>.pog", where 
<familyname> is the family name the user enters when running the 
simulator for the first time.  If, however, the user enters 
his/her family name prefixed with a hyphen, then the family name 
is not incorporated in the trace file name (but the user's name 
still appears in the trace file). 

The trace consists of "snapshots" of the current configuration of 
the machine in the format 

     STACK <CURRENTSTATE> REMAININGINPUT

If more than one quintuple can be applied to a given machine 
configuration, the first listed first in the quintuple file is 
used.  Processing by the pda stops whenever a configuration to 
which no quintuple applies occurs.  

The simulator pauses after each input tape is run.  Hitting any 
key except g or G, causes the simulator to run the next tape.  
Hitting g or G at a pause causes the simulator to run the 
remaining tapes without pauses.  The simulator also pauses 
periodically when running an input tape which requires more moves 
than can be shown on the display screen at one time.  At such a 
pause, hitting s or S (s means stop) cancels further simulation 
on the current tape.  Hitting g or G causes the simulator to run 
without any pauses.  Hitting any other key continues the 
simulation on the current tape. 



SAMPLE QUINTUPLE AND TAPE FILES
-------------------------------

The pda simulator package includes two pairs of sample 
quintuple/input tape files: 

Quintuple file   Input Tape file        Description

q1.p               q1.pp          Accepts { a^nb^n | n >= 0 } by final state
q2.p               q2.pp          Accepts all strings with equal 
                                  number of a's and b's

Here is the pog file that the simulator generates for q1.p and 
q1.pp:
