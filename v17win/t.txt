RUNNING THE TURING MACHINE SIMULATOR
------------------------------------

To run the Turing machine simulator, enter


t /initposition quintuplefilename_less_extension 


The extension ".t" is assumed for the quintuple file name.  The 
tape file name is assumed to be the same as the quintuple file 
name but with the extension is ".tt". 


At least one space must appear between the command line 
arguments. 

The initposition argument is optional.  The initposition argument 
determines the position of the read/write head in the initial 
configuration relative to the beginning of the data on the tape.  
If this argument is omitted, the default value 0 is used.  The 
value specified may be positive (to the right) or negative (to 
the left). 

For example, the following command line specifies -5 for the 
initial position, q1.t for the quintuple file, and q1.tt for the 
tape file: 


t  /-5 q1


NAME FILE t.ttt
---------------

When the simulator is run for the first time, it prompts for the 
user's name:

Enter familyname firstname middleinitial (if any)  

After the user enters this information, the simulator saves it in 
a file named t.ttt.  It then inserts this name information in all 
the trace files it subsequently creates. If the name entered is 
not correct, the t.ttt file can be directly edited with any text 
editor.  Alternatively, the t.ttt file can be deleted.  Then 
when the simulator is run again, it will prompt for and read in 
new name information.  


QUINTUPLE FILE
--------------

The first line of the quintuple file should contain the start 
state of the Turing machine.  The start state can be any integer. 
A comment can appear on the same line as the start state, 
following the start state.    

The final states (i.e., accept states) are listed on the second 
line of the quintuple file.  A final state can be any integer.  
Succesive final states should be separated by at least one blank.  
A comment that does not start with an integer can appear to the 
right of the list of final states. 

If no final states are given, the second line should be 
completely blank or contain a comment that does not start with an 
integer.  If no final states are given, the simulator will not 
generate an ACCEPT/REJECT message for each tape.            

The quintuples for the Turing machine should start on the third 
line.  One quintuple should be specified per line.  Blank lines 
can precede and/or follow any quintuple line.  The components of 
a quintuple should be specified in the following order: 

CURRENTSTATE CURRENTINPUT NEWSTATE NEWSYMBOL MOVE

One or more spaces should separate each component of a quintuple. 
CURRENTSTATE and NEWSTATE can be any integer. 

CURRENTINPUT and NEWSYMBOL can be any non-blank character.  
Use ? to represent a blank. 

MOVE can be one of the following:  

     L or l (for left) 
     R or r (for right) or 
     S or s (for stay in place)  

Comments can appear to the right of each quintuple.

Sample quintuple file:

0                Start state
4                List of final states (i.e., accept states)
0 b 1 x R        This Turing machine accepts {b^nc^n | n >= 1}
1 b 1 b R
1 y 1 y R
1 c 2 y L
2 y 2 y L
2 b 2 b L
2 x 0 x R
0 y 3 y R
3 y 3 y R
3 ? 4 ? R        ? represents a blank



TAPE FILE
---------

The tape file should consist of one or more lines.  Each line 
represents one tape.  A tape can consist of any sequence of 
characters.  Blanks embedded within a tape should be represented 
by ? (one ? for each blank).  A completely blank tape is 
represented by a single ?. 

The t simulator treats each line in the tape file as a separate 
tape and makes one run for each line.  If one or more final 
states are specified and either the letter a or the letter r 
preceded by at least one blank appears on the right of a tape, the 
result of the run--ACCEPT or REJECT--is checked.  If the the 
letter a is specified, the result should be ACCEPT; if the the 
letter r is specified, the result should be REJECT.  If the 
result differs from that specified on a tape, the error message 
"Wrong" appears at the end of the trace for that tape, and the 
error message "Errors detected" appears at the bottom of the 
trace for the entire run.  If no errors are detected during an 
entire run, the message "No errors detected" appears at the 
bottom of the trace for the entire run.  


Sample tape file: 

bc                                                     a
bbcc                                                   a
bbbccc                                                 a
?                 Represents a completely blank tape   r
b                                                      r
c                                                      r
bcc                                                    r
bbc                                                    r
bb???cc           3 embedded blanks                    r



TRACE
-----

The trace generated by the simulator is written to BOTH the 
display screen and a file with the same name as the quintuple 
file but with the added extension ".<familyname>.tog", where 
<familyname> is the family name the user enters when running the 
simulator for the first time.  If, however, the user initially 
enter his/her family name prefixed with a hyphen, then the family 
name is not incorporated in the trace file name (but the user's 
name still appears in the trace file). 

The trace consists of "snapshots" of the current configuration of 
the machine in the format 

     LEFTTAPE [CURRENTSTATE> CURRENTINPUT RIGHTTAPE

If more than one quintuple can be applied to a given machine 
configuration, the first one listed in the quintuple file is 
used.  Processing by the Turing machine stops whenever a 
configuration to which no quintuple applies occurs.  

The simulator pauses after each tape is run.  Hitting any key 
except g or G, causes the simulator to run the next tape.  
Hitting g or G at a pause causes the simulator to run the 
remaining tapes without pauses.  The simulator also pauses 
periodically when running an tape which requires more moves than 
can be shown on the display screen at one time.  At such a pause, 
hitting s or S (s means stop) cancels further simulation on the 
current tape.  Hitting g or G causes the simulator to run without 
any pauses.  Hitting any other key continues the simulation on 
the current tape. 



SAMPLE QUINTUPLE AND TAPE FILES
-------------------------------

The Turing machine simulator package includes two pairs of 
sample files: 

Quintuple file      Tape file        Description

q1.t                 q1.tt         Accepts {a^nb^n | n >= 0}
q2.t                 q2.tt         Computes f(x) = x + 1

Here is the tog file that the simulator generates for q1.t:
